<a name="241"></a><h3>2.4.1 Build 444</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n" id="first" style="margin-left:150px;">
<li>Built with VS2019 using Winamp 5.9-specific internal code
<li>Will only install on Winamp 5.9.0 or newer
<li>Required VS2019 runtimes installed on Win7-8.1 (minimum OS = Win7)
<li>Updated: Lame encoder v3.100.1
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="235"></a><h3>2.3.5 Build 222</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n" id="first" style="margin-left:150px;">
<li>Changed to use Winamp's networking library (jnetlib) instead of the older forked version being used (this will be helpful in the future)</li>
<li>Changed to prompt if Winamp is set to use 24-bit playback mode (which we do not support in this plug-in)</li>
<li>Fixed some setups not being able to connect to a 2.x DNAS in 2.x mode due to the recent 'automatic mode' support and slow DNAS handshaking</li>
<li>Fixed the next song title not being recognised by the DNAS (expects the XML with a specific case of the element names e.g. soon, not SOON)</li>
<li>Fixed the automatic reconnect time being reset to 1 second between sessions</li>
<li>Reduced the memory usage of connections to only allocate the memory needed (this typically only saves a few KB but it's still a saving!)</li>
<li>Miscellaneous code tidyups, documentation updates, branding changes and other small related changes</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="234"></a><h3>2.3.4 Build 210</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>The first Radionomy provided Shoutcast Source DSP release after the sale of Shoutcast (and Winamp) in January 2014</li>
<li>This is primarily a maintenance release to resolve issues and broadcaster requests with the 2.3.x Source DSP since the last build provided under AOL ownership<br></li>
<li>Added 'automatic mode' for selecting the Shoutcast protocol to use which should ease setup issues (there is still the ability to explicitly set the protocol mode like before)</li>
<li>Changed minimum required version of Winamp to v5.6+ due to building changes (below) and to simplify version compatibility and testing</li>
<li>Changed building of the plug-in to better match with the Winamp style for dependent dlls (this saves ~132KB)
<li>Changed title update handling in respect to issues related to CVE-2014-4166 (which we were not informed about before it was disclosed!)</li>
<li>Changed to allow the plug-in to load if lame_enc.dll cannot be found (related to the change below) - previously it would not load at all</li>
<li>Updated genres to the current supported list of genres (as detailed in http://forums.shoutcast.com/showthread.php?t=303241)</li>
<li>Removed lame_enc.dll from the installer - if not present in your Winamp install you will need to manually obtain a copy and place in the Shared folder of your Winamp install</li>
<li>Miscellaneous code tidyups, optimisations, adjustments for future Winamp releases, branding resource changes and other related changes</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="233"></a><h3>2.3.3 Build 201</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Added support for multiple instances of the plug-in so as not to mangle the settings (ini name is now based on the plug-in dll name)</li>
<li>Added blocking of station names with only punctuation in them from being allowed to connect (matches YP-side) and updated illegal list</li>
<li>Added displaying of the metadata and artwork currently present in Winamp when that is the selected mode on the input tab</li>
<li>Added reporting of the 'type' of the artwork on the Winamp metadata panel (generally requires Winamp 5.64+ to work correctly)</li>
<li>Added double-click to view file in explorer on the Winamp metadata panel</li>
<li>Added Winamp v5.64+ safe mode support</li>
<li>Changed how loading of the dialog is handled to try to improve it to appear on top of Winamp if set to load on startup</li>
<li>Changed selecting appropriate input fields to select all text in the field (makes it quicker to enter new port values, etc)</li>
<li>Changed handling of the UI tabs to reduced memory usage where possible</li>
<li>Changed default playing artwork to use jpeg when not able to get the raw artwork on older (<5.6) Winamp clients</li>
<li>Changed main input dialog to hide the soundcard options when in Winamp mode instead of disabling and changing the text</li>
<li>Changed the 'quit' code to better ensure everything applicable is left in a clean state (helps to improve re-opening the window without a complete unload of the plug-in</li>
<li>Fixed loading of the plug-in to not crash / lockup Winamp's UI when lame_enc.dll cannot be found</li>
<li>Fixed Winamp / Soundcard options on the summary tab not being checked on loading</li>
<li>Fixed some of the error indicator drawing appearing incorrectly after closing the window and re-opening (without a complete unload of the plug-in)</li>
<li>Fixed closing the window not working properly next time / after a few repeat closes due to memory corruption issues and not correctly stopping the broadcast threads in all scenarios</li>
<li>Miscellaneous code tidyups, size optimisations (~40kb), crash fixes, improved memory handling and other related changes to improve useability of the plug-in</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="232"></a><h3>2.3.2 Build 189</h3>

<li>Updated list of station names not allows for being listed in the Directory</li>
<li>Updated albumart support to get the raw playing artwork instead of the decoded artwork and having to re-encode to png when using Winamp v5.6+ (still happens on pre-5.6 or if there is an external artwork file due to the Winamp artwork api)</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="231"></a><h3>2.3.1 Build 182</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Added logging of the metadata and artwork details obtained from Winamp before sent to the server (if logging it enabled)</li>
<li>Fixed some connection stability issues when connecting to a remote server (typically happens when in-stream artwork is enabled)</li>

<li>Changed some of the output sub-tab names to make things more consistent</li>
<li>Changed 'user id' to be able to accept the DJ name when used in v1 mode so it will automatically convert it to the 'name:password' format as used with v1 Transcoder DJ connections</li>

<li>Changed the GUID for the plug-in's language file to now be {88380E65-4068-49BA-8EA4-3F2AF12D0A4F} due to the large number of resource changes from the previous releases</li>
<li>Changed user-agent for v1 title updates to match with the v2 metadata's TENC field version (is now "Shoutcast Source DSP x.x.xx Title Update (Mozilla)")</li>
<li>Changed to use Lame 3.99.5 (lame_enc.dll) or the most current version shipped with Winamp (makes it easier to update without a custom built lamedll.dll as previously used)</li>
<li>Changed the 'connect' button to show 'set password' or 'change name' or 'set encoder' or 'set server' when disabled to make it clearer why it's not enabled e.g. if 'unnamed server' or nothing is set for the station name or password fields</li>
<li>Changed default page to be the output page instead of summary on new installs</li>
<li>Changed encoder default to be AAC+ if possible (so it's one less thing to do on loading) and fixed MP3 to default to 96kbps stereo on clean installs</li>
<li>Changed how the dialog is loaded to resolve a part close / crash seen in a few rare cases</li>
<li>Changed the waveInReset(..) change from 2.1.3 back to the pre-2.1.3 behaviour to see if it resolves some of the crash issues reported since the change</li>

<li>Added a refresh capture device button to help update the plug-in if connected capture devices have changed</li>
<li>Changed status info duration to be the time connected rather than a relative date time and allows for more than 24hrs to be displayed e.g. 26:48:57 instead of looping back to 03:48:57</li>
<li>Changed logging to filter 'Status X bytes' messages to only 1 second (if the option to include them is enabled)</li>
<li>Changed log files to use CR+LF linebreaks instead of just LF</li>
<li>Changed logging to remove newlines so each message is a single line to match the status info</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Vista (and potentially Windows 7) where no capture devices are being present resulting in no default capture device known</li>
<li>Fixed crash in SC2 mode when a different cipher is set in the plug-in to the server as well as indicating this error in the status info</li>
