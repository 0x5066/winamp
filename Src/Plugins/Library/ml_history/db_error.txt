
There was an error reading the history database. This could be due to the database becoming corrupted or having been removed.

If the database files (recent.dat and recent.idx) have become corrupted then unless you have a back up, you will need to reset the database.

By resetting the database, any playing history will be lost which also will have happened if the database was corrupted.
